 Description: Chat Application using Google FireBase.
 Model: MVC.
 
 Developed an iOS Chat Application using Google Firebase. It's a chat online application. The welcome screen consists of two buttons. One used to log in and another for Register. In the register screen, after the user enters the username and password it checks for nil value and shows an alert if anyone's field is empty and if both were not empty it requests an API call from Google firebase and fetches response data. If data is an error of shows alert message to a user. Upon success data, it took to messages screen. The above method of authentication and API calls are used for the Login method also. Three Frameworks are used in this application. CLTyping Label and Firebase were integrated using Cocoapods and IQKeyboardManager integrated using Swift Package Dependencies.
 
 Framework Used:
 1. CLTyping Label
                It used for text apperence one after another(Used for Title Animation in welcome screen).
2. FireBase
                Google FireBase used to user Authentication and message storage and retrivel.
3. IQKeyboardManager
                Used for automatic height of chat screen view when user typing message.
